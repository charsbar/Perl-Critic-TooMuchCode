NAME

    Perl::Critic::TooMuchCode - perlcritic add-ons that generally check for
    dead code.

DESCRIPTION

    This add-on for Perl::Critic is aiming for identifying trivial dead
    code. Either the ones that has no use, or the one that produce no
    effect. Having dead code floating around causes maintenance burden.
    Some might prefer not to generate them in the first place.
